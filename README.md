# Crytography
You have to do encrypt and decrypt the given string into following format. 
ex: “an apple laaptopp” --> “a1n1 1a1p2l1e1 1l1a2p1t1o1p2” (&lt;alphabet>&lt;adjacent alphabet count>) 
Consider this example if I give the string as "an apple laaptopp" when encrypt it should return like 
this "a1n1 1a1p2l1e1 1l1a2p1t1o1p2" If suppose I given the encrypted string which means 
"a1n1 1a1p2l1e1 1l1a2p1t1o1p2" that should return "an apple laaptopp"

## Flow
There are two screens, First screen contains two buttons, One is called Encrypt and another
one is called Decrypt. If I press Encrypt/Decrypt button, it will take me to new screen, that
screen contains one text field, one submit button and result label. If I chosen Encrypt, when I
press the submit button, Entered text should encrypt and shown in result label. If text field is
empty then don’t enable the submit button. When i edit the text field, should clear the result
label. Likewise for decryption.
